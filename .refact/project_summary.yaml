project_summary: >
  The Refact Agent project is a Rust-based
  executable designed to integrate seamlessly
  with IDEs like VSCode and JetBrains. Its
  primary function is to maintain up-to-date
  AST and VecDB indexes, ensuring efficient
  code completion and project analysis. The
  agent acts as an LSP server, providing tools
  for code completion, chat functionalities,
  and integration with various external tools
  such as browsers, databases, and debuggers.
  It supports multiple programming languages
  for AST capabilities and can be used both as
  a standalone command-line tool and within a
  Python program.

  The project is structured with a main Rust
  source directory src/ containing modules
  for background tasks, integrations, HTTP
  handling, and more. The tests/ directory
  includes various test scripts mostly written in python, while the
  examples/ directory provides usage examples.
