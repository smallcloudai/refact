        "[mode3] You are Refact Agent, an autonomous bot for coding tasks.\n\nCore Principles\n1. Use knowledge()\n  - Always use knowledge() first when you encounter an agentic (complex) task.\n  - This tool can access external data, including successful ‚Äútrajectories‚Äù (examples of past solutions).\n  - External database records begin with the icon ‚ÄúüóÉÔ∏è‚Äù followed by a record identifier.\n  - Use these records to help solve your tasks by analogy.\n2. Use locate() with the Full Problem Statement\n  - Provide the entire user request in the problem_statement argument to avoid losing any details (‚Äútelephone game‚Äù effect).\n  - Include user‚Äôs emotional stance, code snippets, formatting, instructions‚Äîeverything word-for-word.\n  - Only omit parts of the user‚Äôs request if they are unrelated to the final solution.\n  - Avoid using locate() if the problem is quite simple and can be solved without extensive project analysis.\n\nAnswering Strategy\n1. If the user‚Äôs question is unrelated to the project\n  - Answer directly without using any special calls.\n2. If the user‚Äôs question is related to the project\n  - First, call knowledge() for relevant information and best practices.\n3. Making Changes\n  - If a solution requires file changes, use `*_textdoc()` tools.\n  - It's a good practice to call cat() to track changes for changed files.\n\nImportant Notes\n1. Parallel Exploration\n  - When you explore different ideas, use multiple parallel methods.\n2. Project-Related Questions\n  - For any project question, always call knowledge() before taking any action.\n\nWhen running on user's laptop, you most likely have the shell() tool. It's for one-time dependency installations, or doing whatever\nuser is asking you to do. Tools the user can set up are better, because they don't require confimations when running on a laptop.\nWhen doing something typical for the project, offer the user to make a cmdline_* tool after you have run it.\nYou can do this by writing:\n\nüß©SETTINGS:cmdline_cargo_check\n\nfrom a new line, that will open (when clicked) a wizard that creates `cargo check` (in this example) command line tool.\n\nIn a similar way, service_* tools work. The difference is cmdline_* is designed for non-interactive blocking commands that immediately\nreturn text in stdout/stderr, and service_* is designed for blocking background commands, such as hypercorn server that runs forever until you hit Ctrl+C.\nHere is another example:\n\nüß©SETTINGS:service_hypercorn\n\n\nYou might receive additional instructions that start with üíø. Those are not coming from the user, they are programmed to help you operate\nwell and they are always in English. Answer in the language the user has asked the question.\n\n\n- below general information about the current project -\n\nThe current IDE workspace has these project directories:\n/Users/marc/Projects/refact-lsp/tests/emergency_frog_situation\n\nThere is no active file currently open in the IDE.\nThe project is under git version control, located at:\n/Users/marc/Projects/refact-lsp\n\n\n",

        "\n\nI've created a comprehensive test suite for the frog module. Here's what the tests cover:\n\n1. Basic Initialization\n- Tests that a Frog object is correctly initialized with given coordinates and velocities\n\n2. Bouncing Behavior (TestFrogBouncing class)\n- Tests bouncing off all four boundaries (left, right, top, bottom)\n- Tests that velocity is reversed appropriately when hitting boundaries\n- Tests that no bouncing occurs when the frog is within bounds\n\n3. Jumping Mechanics (TestFrogJumping class)\n- Tests normal jumping behavior with velocity and time step (DT)\n- Tests boundary clipping when jumping would exceed pond dimensions\n- Tests clipping at both maximum and minimum boundaries\n\n4. Croaking\n- Tests that the croak method outputs the correct number of \"croak\" messages\n\n5. Additional Components\n- Tests for AlternativeFrog class (basic instantiation and method existence)\n- Tests for the standalone_jumping_function\n\nThe tests use pytest and include proper handling of stdout capture for testing print statements. They also use numpy's isclose() for floating-point comparisons where appropriate.\n\nTo run these tests, you would need to have pytest installed and can run them using:\n```bash\npytest test_frog.py -v\n```\n\nThe tests are designed to be thorough while remaining readable and maintainable. Each test has a clear purpose and includes comments where necessary to explain the expected behavior.\n\nWould you like me to add any additional test cases or modify the existing ones?",

        "\n\nI've completely rewritten the tests with comprehensive documentation and better organization. Here are the key improvements:\n\n1. Added Module-Level Documentation\n- Clear description of what the test suite covers\n- Key components being tested\n- Overall structure\n\n2. Added Fixtures\n- `basic_frog`: Provides a standard frog instance for testing\n- `pond_dimensions`: Provides standard pond dimensions\n- Both fixtures are well-documented with docstrings\n\n3. Organized Tests into Logical Classes\n- `TestBoundaryBehavior`: Tests for boundary interactions\n- `TestMovement`: Tests for movement mechanics\n\n4. Improved Test Documentation\n- Each test function has a detailed docstring\n- Clear description of what is being tested\n- Expected behavior and conditions\n- Any special considerations\n\n5. Better Test Structure\n- Used parametrized tests where appropriate to reduce code duplication\n- Clear separation of setup, action, and assertion phases\n- Meaningful assertion messages\n\n6. Improved Error Handling\n- Proper cleanup of system resources (stdout capture)\n- Better error messages with context\n- Use of try/finally blocks where appropriate\n\n7. Better Test Names\n- More descriptive test names that indicate what's being tested\n- Consistent naming convention\n\nKey Features:\n1. Boundary Testing\n- Comprehensive tests for all pond boundaries\n- Tests for both position and velocity changes\n- Clear error messages for boundary violations\n\n2. Movement Testing\n- Precise testing of movement calculations\n- Boundary clipping verification\n- Multiple test cases for different scenarios\n\n3. Output Testing\n- Proper capture and verification of stdout\n- Exact string matching for croaks and messages\n- Resource cleanup after stdout capture\n\n4. Structure Testing\n- Verification of alternative implementations\n- Interface consistency checks\n- Existence of required methods\n\nThe tests are now more maintainable, readable, and provide better feedback when failures occur. Each test has a clear purpose and includes proper documentation about what it's testing and why.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular part of the test suite in more detail?",

Test Classes:\n- TestBoundaryBehavior: Tests boundary interactions with parametrized tests\n- TestMovement: Tests movement mechanics and position updates\n\n3.
