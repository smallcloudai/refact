## Getting Started

Download Refact for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smallcloud.codify) or [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20647-refact-ai).

You can start using Refact Cloud immediately, just create an account at [https://refact.ai/](https://refact.ai/).

Instructions below are for the self-hosted version.


### Running Refact Self-Hosted in a Docker Container

The easiest way to run the self-hosted server is a pre-build Docker image.

Install [Docker with NVidia GPU support](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker).
On Windows you need to install WSL 2 first, [one guide to do this](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install).


Run docker container with following command:
```commandline
docker run -d --rm -p 8008:8008 -v perm-storage:/perm_storage --gpus all smallcloud/refact_self_hosting
```

`perm-storage` is a volume that is mounted inside the container. All the configuration files,
downloaded weights and logs are stored here.

To upgrade the docker, delete it using `docker kill XXX` (the volume `perm-storage` will retain your
data), run `docker pull smallcloud/refact_self_hosting` and run it again.

Now you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8008 to see the server Web GUI.


<details><summary>Docker commands super short refresher</summary>
Add your yourself to docker group to run docker without sudo (works for Linux):

```commandline
sudo usermod -aG docker {your user}
```

List all containers:

```commandline
docker ps -a
```

Start and stop existing containers (stop doesn't remove them):

```commandline
docker start XXX
docker stop XXX
```

Shows messages from a container:
```commandline
docker logs -f XXX
```

Remove a container and all its data (except data inside a volume):
```commandline
docker rm XXX
```

Check out or delete a docker volume:
```commandline
docker volume inspect VVV
docker volume rm VVV
```
</details>

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for installation without a docker container.

## How Refact Works

Under the hood, it uses Refact models and the best open-source models.

At the moment, you can choose between the following models:

| Model                                                                                | Completion | Chat | AI Toolbox | Fine-tuning |
