Privacy settings allow you to control the level of confidentiality to ensure the confidentiality of your code. 

There are three levels of privacy you can choose from in Refact.
Levels of privacy can be modified in the plugin dashboard. 
## Level 0
With this level of privacy, Refact will not have access to files and data won't be sent to a third-party model.

> With this level of privacy you won't be able to use any of the Refact commands like `Explain code` or `Completion`

## Level 1
With Level 1 of privacy, Refact has access to your files but data is protected from sending to a third-party model.

At Refact, your privacy and control over your data are fundamental principles that guide our approach. We are committed to providing a secure and reliable environment for all our users, whether you choose to utilize our cloud services or set up a self-hosted server. Your trust is important to us, and we're here to support your coding journey while safeguarding your data every step of the way.

When working with code blocks that use third-party APIs you will receive an error that indicates you need to switch to a Level 2 privacy in order to get a precise analysis of the code.

If you open the tab of the `Explain Code` tab, you will see an error message at the top section

### Refact Cloud Version
When using Refact's cloud version, data is sent to our servers for processing. However, it's important to note that we do not collect datasets on the server side. Your code and information are used solely to enhance your coding experience and provide you with intelligent suggestions.

### Refact Self-Hosted Version
For users who opt for the self-hosted version of Refact, your data stays within your control. When you run a self-hosted server, your data is sent exclusively to your server. This ensures that your code and information remain within your infrastructure, giving you complete control over your data.

## Level 2
With Level 2 of privacy, Refact has access to files, and data is not protected from sending to third-party models like GPT-3.5
